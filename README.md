### The Assignment Writeup

For every assignment in CS70, this `README.md` file will be your first stop. It will outline the big-picture context of the assignment, relevant reading, and how the assignment will be graded.

After reading the overview, but before jumping into any work, you should take a look at each of the parts of the assignment. If you're viewing this repository in the GitHub website, you can click the "Issues" tab above to see a list of the open Issues. Each of the Issues will have three parts: 

**Background**: This section will explain the motivation and larger context for the work you're doing on a given issue. It may also provide some background information that you need to get started. 

**Turn In**:This section will give you an itemized to-do list of steps you need to take to complete this Issue. As you work, you can check off each of the items on the list. When you view all of the issues as a list, GitHub will give you a progress bar showing how many of the items in this section have been checked off for each issue. Additionally, the grutors will use this list as a starting point when they grade your assignment. 

**Helpful Hints**: This section will include bits of advice and answers to commonly-asked questions that we think will make your experience better. We highly recommend that you read through these *before* you start working on each step.
